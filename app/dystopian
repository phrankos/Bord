**Survive or Thrive: The Choice is Yours**

Are you drowning in a world of monotony and despair, seeking a glimmer of hope? Do you have the audacity to embrace challenges for survival or profit? BORD, the last beacon of light in this bleak landscape, offers you a chance to claw your way out of the abyss.

**How it Works**

1. **Askers**: Are you a visionary amidst the chaos, with the means to exploit the desperation of others? Post a task along with the prize money (ETH) you're willing to sacrifice. Your whims dictate the fate of the desperate on BORD.

2. **Doers**: Ready to risk life and limb for a chance at sustenance or wealth? Browse through tasks posted by Askers and choose the ones that promise a slim hope of survival or profit. Your desperation fuels the engine of exploitation!

3. **Film & Upload**: Once you've chosen a task, film yourself completing it and upload the video to BORD. Your struggles are broadcasted for the entertainment of the masses.

4. **Judges**: A panel of Judges, handpicked by those in power, will review your performance based on the task given by the Asker. Their judgment is final, their biases undeniable.

5. **Prize Money**: If the Judges deem your performance worthy of survival or profit, you'll be awarded the prize money set by the Asker. If not, you'll be cast back into the depths of despair, awaiting your next opportunity to claw your way out.
